# MVP-Market-Hub 

When creating an innovative ecommerce marketplace, it is vital to prioritize the user experience, effectively manage the project's scope, and be transparent about any shortcuts taken.

User Experience: Our main focus is to create a streamlined and intuitive interface that ensures a positive user experience. We take into account the needs of recruiters and hiring managers who will evaluate our work. We provide easy access to the platform without requiring users to create accounts or provide personal details. Our goal is to ensure smooth navigation, presenting information in a clear and organized manner.

Scope: Striking a balance between functionality and manageability is crucial for this project. We opt for a smaller scope that allows for iterative deployment, testing, and bug fixes. By narrowing down the features to the essentials, we can develop a more polished product. Documenting the scope helps track progress and make informed decisions throughout the development process.

Shortcuts: While it is acceptable to leverage shortcuts for faster development, it is important to be transparent about them. We intend to clearly communicate any shortcuts taken and have a plan in place to address them if time allows. For example, we might initially use file-based storage instead of a database or hard-code certain values. These shortcuts can help create an end-to-end proof of concept to demonstrate feasibility, especially if the primary challenge lies elsewhere. However, we are prepared to revisit and improve these areas in subsequent iterations.

By giving priority to user experience, effectively managing the project's scope, and openly acknowledging any shortcuts, we can develop an MVP that not only adds value to users but also lays a strong foundation for future iterations. Remember, the focus should be on creating a functional prototype that can be tested, refined, and scaled based on user feedback and market validation.
